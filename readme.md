# a bunch of useful scripts


## shift_time_fix_gopro.sh
I have an older version of gopro.  It just resets the time to the default whenever I switch battery.  I often forget to set it to the correct time.
So I just created this script to adjust/shift timestamps of all files in a directory to another time with reference with another file and its correct time.
You need to indentify a file that's the earliest in your collection.  Then use this file's correct time as a reference.

This script was only tested on Mac.
